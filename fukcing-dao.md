# Fukcing DAO

A DAO is an inevitable part of the game. Fukcing DAO will have two main goals; Voting for upcoming updates and sensitive content.

We will discuss and vote on the upcoming updates or on the current features to remove or update. They can decide whether it should be implemented in the game or not. If we will implement an update, DAO can open a discussion about the content of the update. It can be the art style of it or a specific feature of it. Basically, players will actively participate in the development of the game.

The second purpose of the DAO is to prevent unpleasant situations that may occur in the future. Because everyone can upload a level boss and select or even elect it as a level boss, it creates a space for those who have bad intentions.&#x20;

Community members can open a discussion about a boss that has been created and listed in the game. If they find it unpleasant to take a part in the game, they can vote to remove it completely. If your identity takes a place in an unpleasant situation, you can report it we will remove it from being used.

### Fukcing DAO Tokens (FDAO)

Fukcing DAO tokens will be minted by contributing elections, and selections. When people burn FUKC tokens in the elections and selections, they will receive their FDAO tokens. Masters will receive as much as backers and selectors received in the previous seance. Therefore Masters will represent 50% of the Fukcing DAO.

For instance, when you burn or spend 1,000 FUKC tokens in elections, you'll receive 1,000 FDAO. If all players spent or burned a total of 50,000 FUKC in that seance, 1,000 Master will receive a total of 50,000 FDAO tokens after that seance.

Unlike other governance tokens, FDAO tokens can not be transferred to anyone, and thus can not be sold. You can not buy Fucking DAO tokens, you only can earn them by burning FUKC tokens or being a Fukcing Master.
