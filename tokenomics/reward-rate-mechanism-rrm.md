# Reward Rate Mechanism (RRM)

Fighters who manage to fukc the bosses will share %50 of the Boss Rewards. Every boss has a different amount of reward depending on the funding they got from backers.&#x20;

For instance, a level 5 boss has 10,000 FUKC in its treasury and gets fukc by fighters 1000 times. If you were one of the fighters and fukced that boss 10 times, your share is 10 out of 1000 which is 1%. Therefore, you would get 100 FUKC from that boss.

But there is a **Reward Rate Mechanism** that affects your earnings that comes from boss fukc. Your reward rate will decrease by 2% after each fukc regardless of the level of the boss. For instance, after 25 fukc, your reward rate will decrease to 0.5 from 1. If you can't complete the level and can't fukc the boss, then your reward rate will remain the same.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
RewardRate = RewardRate - 0.02 | After each fukc
{% endhint %}

This system encourages the players to play at the highest level they can play and discourages the potential bots to exploit treasury and leave actual players poor. Additionally, you won't feel like lacking behind other players when you can't play all day. A player can play as long as he/she wants but only can earn for his/her first 50 fukcs.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
RewardX = RewardRate \* LevelXPoints | Where X is the level
{% endhint %}

Every level has a different Reward pool named RewardX, where X is the level. For instance, if you have 5 **Reward1** points and the total point in the Reward1 pool is 100, then your share is 5 out of 100, which is 5%. You will get 5% of the treasury of the level 1 boss.&#x20;

When you fukc level 1 boss for the first time, you would earn 1 Reward1 point. If you fukc level 1 boss a second time, you would earn 0.98 Reward1 point because your Reward Rate decreased to 0.98. Your total Reward1 point would be 1.98 after 2 fukc. If you continue to level 2 boss for your third fukc, you would earn 0.96 Reward2 points. If you continue to upper levels **without repeating any level**, you would earn 0.62 Reward20 points. Even though your reward rate is decreasing, it doesn't mean you would earn less. Because everyone's reward rate is decreasing. Therefore, you would share the same amount.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Reward Rate resets to 1 every day at 12 AM (GMT). But levels you unlocked will remain.

Reward Rate Mechanism

* encourages players to play a decent amount of time. Not all day.
* encourages players to play at higher levels. Distributing skills well.
* discourages the potential bots.
* distribute the reward more fairly.
{% endhint %}

There will be other mechanisms to prevent future bots to exploit the treasury. The **Reward Rate Mechanism** is protective enough for the short and mid-term and almost none of the P2E games has a mechanism like this. You can be sure that we will continue to increase our protection of players as we proceed.
