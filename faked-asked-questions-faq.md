# Faked Asked Questions (FAQ)

Q: How to select a character for a level to fuck?

A: To select a character, you need to burn some amount of token. The first level will require 1 FUKC (token) to select. The token requirement will increase 10-fold for the following levels. For instance, level 5 will require 10000 FUKC to select a character. Each selected character will be listed in the next seance's candidate list. People will burn tokens to choose the next seance's character for each level. Once you burn tokens to choose, you can not get back your tokens. If your character isn't chosen, you'll lose your money.\


**Q: How much people will earn for each character they fukc?**&#x20;

A: It depends on 3 main parameters: how many people can fuck the character, how many tokens burned for that character to choose, and the level. The reward will be distributed among all the fuckers after each seance. For instance, if 100 people fucks a character for just one time, the reward will be distributed to these 100 people equally. Your reward will increase as you fuck the same character.

**Q: Why it is "Fukc" instead of "Fuck"?**

**A:** We are the crypto community. We hodl, we buidl, and we fukc!

**Q: Most of the blockchain games have the same max supply and total supply. But WeFukc is different. Why is that?**

**A:** We are doing the same thing but with a different path. The result is the same. We chose NOT TO pre-mint and lock the tokens. The reasons are:

* It shows the real total supply. Otherwise, you have to manually calculate the total supply. Which opens a door for manipulation.
* The circulation supply becomes equal to the total supply which is the real total supply. Take a look at a random project like Mist on BSC. It's one of the team lockup contracts that have only 46 tokens but CoinGecko and Coinmarketcap consider it has 1.1 million tokens inside when they calculate the "circling supply". This means both total and circulation supply are not true. Consequently, that makes the market cap value false as well! Because market cap = circulation supply \* token price. When the circulation supply is not correct, the market cap is not correct as well. This is a huge problem when people try to calculate the real valuation and future potential of the project.&#x20;
* If you search a bit, you'll see many projects even do not show their code of vesting (locked) contracts. And you can't be sure if tokens are locked for 1 year or 1 month. In our contract, it is clear how long the real vesting time and other numbers such as total supply. You can watch our Youtube videos to see all of these.

**Q: What is free and what is not?**

**A:** Lord -> 10,000 FUKC, boss -> 1,000 FUKC, clan -> 1,000 FUKC

**Q: Where does my money goes when I mint a Lord NFT, mint a Boss, or Create a Clan?**

**A:** All of them burn! When you mint a Lord NFT, Boss NFT, or create a clan,&#x20;

**Q: What if the price of FUKC would be as high as 100 dollars? Minting a boss would cost 10,000 dollars. Wouldn't it be too high?**

**A:** DAO will change the price of mint if the prices go too high.

**Q: Why team and airdrop allocations are the same?**&#x20;

**A:** We are building this as a team but you are making it meaningful as a community. Altogether, we are creating value. The product is half of the valuation and the community is the second half. Therefore we should share it equally.

**Q: Why you don't sell any tokens?**&#x20;

**A:** The best token sale is no token sale. In our case, we can do that. But if this project would require so much capital to build, we would have to sell some tokens to build it. Thankfully, we didn't need it. We managed to build it with our own resources. But as you know, the product we launch is version 1. There are many things that we want to build on top of it and improve. This is why we have game development allocation.
