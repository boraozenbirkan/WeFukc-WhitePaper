# Masters and Clans

Clans will be the most influential part of the boss elections. Therefore, it is highly important to be a part of a clan and act together to save your ass and kick some ass.

Apart from the organizational benefit of clans, they will have three different privileges. Clans fights, gameplay customization, and direct contact with developers and community managers.

### Clan Incomes

After every seance, 10% of the clan members' earnings that comes from clan fights will go to the clan's treasury. 10% of that treasury will go to the Master of the clan. The remaining 90% will be managed by the clan leader.

Clans can use it as they wish. They can open customized gameplay features, create a reward system, give some salaries to their high-ranked officers, make mini games among each other, etc.

### Clan Fights

Clans fights are PvP fights that will occur in 3v3 and 5v5 modes. All team players will be a member of the same clan.&#x20;

There will also be tournaments among clans. Tournaments and clan fights will have different prize pools. If you want to be alone and not participate in any of these, watch your ass in elections.&#x20;

For those who wonder that "who shall we fukc if there is no boss?". Yes, you probably guessed right! Your opponents! Members of the winning clan will fukc the members of the clan that loses! It will be so hard to watch. It isn't the level boss, it's you who gets fukced up!

### Customize Gameplay

Clans will be able to customize some of the content of the game into whatever they want. It is like the level boss, but it will be available just for the members of the clan. Not global. Basically, clans that are big enough to burn some amount of FUKC to activate that feature for their clan will be able to do that.&#x20;

You can think that like boosting a Discord server. If your clan collects some amount of FUKC to burn, your clan will be able to upload its own SFX and VFX of the player and the enemy. All clan members will have the same SFX and VFX. They can choose the default options or choose the clan's options.

### How to Create a Clan?

All clans need a Fukcing Master to be a real clan in the game. Therefore, after forming your clans with your friends and community, you need to find a Master to be registered in the game.

Masters create a smart contract on the blockchain and make the clan leader the owner of that contract. By owning the clan contract, the leader can manage the clan members and the clan funds. The only leader can change the owner of the clan contract. Thus, the leader of the clan.

## Fucking Masters

Masters are the creator of all the clans in the game. Master NFTs have different properties but their rarity of properties doesn't matter at all. All masters have exact same functionality. Therefore, you can buy whichever you like!

Masters will have passive income through their clans. 10% of the clans' treasury will be transferred to their masters. They will represent 50% of the [Fukcing DAO](fukcing-dao.md). Master NFTs have no royalty fee!

### How to be a Fukcing Master?

There will be a **maximum of 1,000** Masters. This means all the clans in the game will be under those 1,000 Master. You can be a master by having a Fucking Master NFT. Master NFTs will be sold by We Fukc at a price of $1,000. After all of the masters are sold out, you can buy them from any NFT marketplace if their owners sell any.
