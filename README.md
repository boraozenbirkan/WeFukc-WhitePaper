# We FUKC

We Fukc is a protest platformer game. With the Web3 revolution, players truly own the items and their data. With We Fukc, players not only own the data, but they also change the content of the game from level boss to SFX.&#x20;

There are 20 levels in We Fukc and each level has its own level boss. In a normal game, you would fight against the level boss, right? But it is not the case here. **WE FUKC** the level boss.&#x20;

It is worth noting that everyone fukcs the exact same boss on a level. **Every week is a different seance in the game.** And for each seance players create their own custom boss and select it as a candidate for the next seance's level. Then again players select the level boss among these candidates for each level. Once players select a boss for a level, all players fukc that boss on that level in the following seance!

If you want to learn more about creating, selecting, and electing a level boss, you can check the "[Minting and Electing Boss](tokenomics/minting-and-electing-boss.md)" page.&#x20;

Let's talk about our other differences from most of the P2E games in the ecosystem

| Subject                     | We Fukc                                                                                                                   | Others                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sales**                   | No token sale at all, No NFT sale, No VC investments, No entry fee. It's all fukcing free!                                | Almost all of them hold several token and NFT sales. VCs hold large amount of their token and you pay to play. Classic. |
| C**ommunity Allocation**    | **+90%** of total supply allocated for players!                                                                           | Generally around **40% to 60%** allocation for players                                                                  |
| **Team Allocation**         | Just **4%** for the team                                                                                                  | Generally around **15% to 30%** alocation for the team                                                                  |
| **Income Mechanism**        | Dynamic income. Fewer players earn more, more players earn less. Just like Bitcoin or other blockchains' income mechanism | Fixed income leads to a collapse after a certain point.                                                                 |
| **Reward Rate Mechanism**   | Prevents bots from consuming all the treasury and distributes it more fairly                                              | Most of them don't have such a protective mechanism. Bots earn the most of the treasury                                 |
| **Read and Write Approach** | Players add and change the content of the game collectively                                                               | Players only play the same game                                                                                         |

### Web3 Culture

Here we do many things quite different and in a fairer way. // Adjust the intro, write differences //

| Web2                                                                                                                                                                      | Web3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Fighting with Boss                                                                                                                                                        | Fukcing Boss. Yeah, we have more fun!                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| You can't invest in a game and make a profit. Just pay and/or play                                                                                                        | You can invest as you wish! There are many ways to make a profit from a game for individuals!                                                                                                                                                       |
| You don't own anything that you earned in the game. All of them belong to the publishing company. They let you play as long as they make money out of you!                | Players truly own what they earn in the game. All the items are really yours, in NFT format. If the publisher closes the game, you can use your items in other games that welcome you!                                                              |
| As a player, you probably know very well that the community has very little voice to make changes in the game. We have to accept what they present us in web2 culture     | Web3 is totally different. It is like the constitution of games that gives players rights to affect the course of the game with the DAO. You can even fire the CEO and other executives if you find them unsuccessful!                              |
| You are the customer                                                                                                                                                      | You are the owner!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Companies that provide free services like Facebook or Twitter sell you to make money. Yes, you. Your data is you. Be aware of it. Because they know you, better than you! | Web3 companies don't need to sell you to generate revenue. They have many ways to generate sustainable revenue thanks to the tokenomics that blockchain technology provides!                                                                        |
| Web2 companies are hungry! They have commissions up to 30-40% of your earnings! Amazon, Google, Spotify, etc.                                                             | Web3 companies have much more lower commission rates like 2-10% or even less. This is because there are tokenomics that provide a fairer and better revenue generation and sharing culture. Web3 generates its value by sharing wealth and control. |

Even though it is better, you may think that it is not enough for you or society. You have your voice here, you have control and the opportunity to make the changes that you wish. This is Web3, this is yours. It is up to you to make it in the way you wish to see it. <mark style="color:red;">**Do not ever forget,**</mark> that you are the owner,  not the customer!
