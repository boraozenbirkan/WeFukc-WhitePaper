# Lords

## Fukcing Lords

Lords are the creator of all the clans in the game. Lord NFTs have different properties but their rarity of properties doesn't matter at all. All Lords have exact same functionality. Therefore, you can have whichever you like!

Lords will have passive income by taxing clans. 10% of the clans' treasury will be transferred to their Lords. They will represent 50% of the [Fukcing DAO](fukcing-dao.md). Lords NFTs have no royalty fee!

As a lord, you can mint creation NFTs and give or sell it to a clan leader who wants to create a clan. The minting cost of Clan Creation NFT will be 1,000 FUKC tokens to prevent the Lords from creating fake clans to protect their Lord NFT against potential rebellions. Check the [Clans](clans.md#rebellion) page to learn more about rebellions.

### How to be a Fukcing Lord?

There will be a **maximum of 512** Lords. This means all the clans in the game will be under those 512 Lords. You can be a Lord by having a Fucking Lord NFT. You can mint your Lord NFT after the release of the game with a price of 10,000 FUKC tokens. After all of the Lords are sold out, you can buy them from any NFT marketplace if their owners sell any.

#### Team, Clan, and Fighter Allocations

100 Lord NFTs are allocated for the team, clans, and fighters. Clans and fighters will earn Lord NFTs with a lottery system. The remaining 412 Lord NFTs will be available for the public to mint.

Clans will earn tickets with their activities and fighters will earn tickets with their down-tier earnings. Just like in the [Up-Tier Lottery](tokenomics/up-tier-lottery.md) system. Every seance, we will hold a separate lottery with the prize of 1 Lord NFT for the fighters. That means you have a chance for each seance!&#x20;

On the other hand, clans will have half of their allocation before the launch of the game. And the other half will be distributed after the launch with the same lottery-based mechanism. Each clan and fighter can only earn 1 Lord NFT. Winners will be excluded from the lottery. Activity points of the clans will be announced later!

* 412 for the public (80.5% of total Lords)
* 50 for the team (9.8% of total Lords)
* 25 for the clans (4.8% of total Lords)
* 25 for fighters (4.8% of total Lords)
