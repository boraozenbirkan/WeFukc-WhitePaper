# Lords and Clans

Clans will be the most influential entity in the boss elections. Therefore, it is highly important to be a part of a clan and act together to save your ass and kick some ass.

Apart from the organizational benefit of clans, they will have three different privileges. Clans fights, gameplay customization, and direct contact with developers and community managers.

### Clan Fights

Clans fights are PvP fights that will occur in 3vs3, and 5vs5 modes. All team players will be a member of the same clan.&#x20;

There will also be tournaments among clans. Tournaments and clan fights will have different prize pools. If you want to be alone and not participate in any of these, watch your ass in elections.&#x20;

For those who wonder that "who shall we fukc if there is no boss?". Yes, you probably guessed right! Your opponents! Members of the winning clan will fukc the members of the clan that loses! It will be so hard to watch. It isn't the level boss, it's you who gets fukced up!

### Clan Incomes

After every seance, 10% of the clan members' earnings that comes from clan fights will go to the clan's treasury. 10% of that treasury will go to the Lord of the clan. The remaining 90% will be managed by the clan leader.

Clans can use it as they wish. They can open customized gameplay features, create a reward system, give some salaries to their high-ranked officers, make mini games among each other, etc.

### Customize Gameplay

Clans will be able to customize some of the content of the game into whatever they want. It is like the level boss, but it will be available just for the members of the clan. Not global. Basically, clans that are big enough to burn some amount of FUKC to activate that feature for their clan will be able to do that.&#x20;

You can think that like boosting a Discord server. If your clan collects some amount of FUKC to burn, your clan will be able to upload its own SFX and VFX of the player and the enemy. All clan members will have the same SFX and VFX. They can choose the default options or choose the clan's options.

### How to Create a Clan?

All clans need a Fukcing Lord to be a real clan in the game. Therefore, after forming your clan with your friends and community, you need to find a Lord to be registered in the game.

Lords mint a special Clan Creation NFT and give it (or sell it) to the clan leaders. You can buy it from the market or directly from the lord. Once you have the Clan Creation NFT, you can create your clan by burning it with a special smart contract. After creating your clan, you enlist your fighters in your clan and start to load up your clan treasury. 16% of the treasury will be sent to the Lord as a tax. The remaining 84% will be controlled by the clan leader. The leader can spend it as he or she wishes. Our recommendation is to provide some salary for the high command of the clan and reward talented players in the clan.

## Fukcing Lords

Lords are the creator of all the clans in the game. Lord NFTs have different properties but their rarity of properties doesn't matter at all. All Lords have exact same functionality. Therefore, you can have whichever you like!

Lords will have passive income through their clans. 10% of the clans' treasury will be transferred to their Lords. They will represent 50% of the [Fukcing DAO](fukcing-dao.md). Lords NFTs have no royalty fee!

As a lord, you can mint creation NFTs and give or sell it to a clan leader who wants to create a clan.&#x20;

### How to be a Fukcing Lord?

There will be a **maximum of 512** Lords. This means all the clans in the game will be under those 512 Lords. You can be a Lord by having a Fucking Lord NFT. You can mint your Lord NFT after the release of the game with a price of 10,000 FUKC tokens. After all of the Lords are sold out, you can buy them from any NFT marketplace if their owners sell any.

#### Team, Clan, and Fighter Allocations

100 Lord NFTs are allocated for the team, clans, and fighters. Clans and fighters will earn Lord NFTs with a lottery system. The remaining 412 Lord NFTs will be available for the public to mint.

Clans will earn tickets with their activities and fighters will earn tickets with their down-tier earnings. Just like in the [Up-Tier Lottery](tokenomics/up-tier-lottery.md) system. Every seance, we will hold a separate lottery with the prize of 1 Lord NFT for the fighters. That means you have a chance for each seance!&#x20;

On the other hand, clans will have half of their allocation before the launch of the game. And the other half will be distributed after the launch with the same lottery-based mechanism. Each clan and fighter can only earn 1 Lord NFT. Winners will be excluded from the lottery. Activity points of the clans will be announced later!

* 50 for the team
* 25 for the clans
* 25 for fighters
