# Gameplay

There are 20 levels in We Fukc. Every 5 levels have a different theme and enemies to fight against. After completing a level, you can finally fukc the level boss. Please enjoy it.

&#x20;Every level has different paths to complete the level. These paths can be longer or shorter than each other and have a different set of difficulties in terms of the number of enemies, the type of enemies, and the number of traps.

There will be different heroes that players can play with. Each hero will have different characteristics and skills that are suitable for different situations. You can select any of them and kick some ass.

If you want to create your own custom boss for players to fukc or participate in the election of the bosses, you can check the "[Minting and Electing Boss](tokenomics/minting-and-electing-boss.md)" page.
