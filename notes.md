## **Notes for this project:**

* Motto: Let's Fukc! | PoF system: Proof-of-Fukc
* Our logo: Black Heart
* We will store the character data in both IPFS and our servers to have an efficient system. When people mint a character, they will have its NFT with metadata that is stored in IPFS but when they play the game we will send the data directly from our server to provide better performance.
* **Taking back your funds from a selection:** It can be cool but it would give a lot of harm to people and demotivate them to participate in the selection. For instance, a whale can create 2 characters and stake 1000 tokens to one of them and 100 to the other. People stake their funds in the biggest character to guarantee to be on the winning side. Then whale can withdraw its funds from the biggest character right before the ending of the selections.  Then the whale's little character wins the selection and the whale gets all the money for him with a little fund. Making 10x-20x return in just 1 selection. So, we can't implement withdraw function to the selections. Whales still can manipulate the selections by funding multiple characters and making a final move at the last second but in this case whales' earnings would be nothing if we compare it to the scenario when there is a withdraw function. Because they would lose all the tokens they fund on their fake characters. Withdraw function reduces the competitiveness of the low-budget players and ruins the whole game.
* The market price at TGE: 1 cent, therefore 4k market cap
  * **Dumping:** We can it 1 dollar but then the market cap would be 400k and it will be all in the hands of airdrop hunters. They can dump it and if we can't hold it, it goes 0. **Airdrop hunters should be in a mindset not to sell but play and have fun with it.**&#x20;
  * **Liquidity Problem:** We will have 400k FUKC for the liquidity pool. We have to have a number of dollars to support it. If the price would be 1 dollar, then we have to provide 400k dollars with 400k FUKC. This is why 1 cent is a good price. We only have to provide 4k dollars for 400k FUKC.
  * **Pumping:** It can skyrocket from 1 cent but it can't from 1 dollar. If we reach a 4m market cap from 1 dollar, it would make it 10 dollars, which is 10x. But if we reach the same market cap from 1 cent, it would make it again 10 dollars but this time with 1000x instead of 10x. This price action would attract people to invest even though they don't play.
* <mark style="color:red;">**Legal Problems**</mark>: If the game hits a large number of players or even some people start to sue me because of this, it would be a huge problem for me. Therefore I should act like a big tech platform.
  * Everyone can upload manipulated sexual content about anyone on the internet. It can be on Twitter, Facebook, etc. But if the victim requests from the platform to remove the content, platforms remove it immediately. We will do the same. And we will avoid Gif or video content to be less annoying. Just name, a picture, and our default stickman. People will be able to customize the stickman in our terms to make it more related to the boss. Other features of the boss (such as background image) can be added at first and tested. If it brings too much trouble, we can remove it as well.
  * We should add a warning and "I understand and accept" tick in the boss creation section. We must say: "Please do not use any real identity as a boss. It would be a violation of human rights and subject to removal. Please use only fictional entities as a boss!"

### Gameplay Notes

* Profit Index: Every level selection will have a profit index to warn or encourage people about the profit/loss they can get. If people lock too many the index should be red and low!
  * Additionally, we should add a warning to the elections that says "Learn the election mechanisms and fund a reasonable amount to protect yourself against the high risks!"
* We will keep players' earnings centrally held but every player can get their funds anytime. Even if players don't get their funds, we will send their funds to their wallets automatically if their funds are worth more than 100 dollars.&#x20;
* Every 5 levels should have a different environment to play like different seasons. Like first 5 levels are green, bright, and a happy environment with easy enemies. But the last 5 levels (16-20) are the hardest and darkest environment. Let's call these different environments chapters.
  * Chapter 1: Green, happy, open space. Human enemies. Easy traps, less dangerous.
  * Chapter 2: Castle, Human enemies with enhanced armament. Tricky traps, give more damage.
  * Chapter 3: Underground, cave-like environment. Creatures start to appear, dreadful traps that give more damage.
  * Chapter 4: Core of the earth. Lava. Deamon-like mini-bosses and creatures. 1 shot traps.
  * Elements of different chapters: **3 types of enemy, 1 mini-boss, traps, and mapping.**
* We should provide a preview of the sex scene on the minting page. People should be able to see what they are minting. It is $100 dollar!
* The whole system resets every seance, the Reward Rate resets every day, and the Path Difficulties resets every hour.
* We should add a **warning** and "I understand and accept" tick in the boss creation section like Binance does in important things. We must say: "Please do not use any real identity as a boss. It would be a violation of human rights and subject to removal. Please use only fictional entities as a boss!"
* Fundamental armamanet:&#x20;
  * Police baton, baseball bat, club, knife, sword, and Axe for handed weapons.
  * Pistol, shotgun, rifle, and grenade for ranged weapons.
  * Helmet and vest for defense.
* Armaments: People will burn FUKC tokens to mint these weapons and their bullets. Bullets and grenades will have a burn method that only can be used by the project owner. We will burn people's bullets after a fight. If a player starts the game with 100 bullets and only fires 20 of them, we will burn 20 bullets of that specific weapon after the fight.
* Higher levels will be longer and harder to pass. Therefore, people will need more health to complete. We can not give them different max health at different levels or increase the defense point of the shields relatively. It would be awful. A better solution is making enemies drop health when they die. Stronger enemies drop the on the same chance but give more health due to the difficulty of the level. Health drop chance would be a global variable to set and all enemies would fetch it at the beginning of the level.

## **Future Implementations:**

### **Short Term**

* There will be lists like "Most Fukced", "Best Fukcer" and some medals like "The Best Fukcer of Seance #35" or "Serial Fukcer"
* Add hidden places as a bonus. Those hidden places should be randomly selected. But they would be on the most difficult paths more often.
  * There will be different types of heroes that are suitable for different environments. We can hide gems in places where players can't reach the most suitable hero. For instance, there are two different heroes. One of them is so strong but heavy, the other one light but fast. And you can complete a level with a strong hero. We can hide a gem in that level in a place where players can only reach with that light and fast hero. Maybe it jumps higher? The thing is players who discover this truth and play with an unsuitable hero to find the gem should be able to find it.
* New Weapons and enemies.
* Rage for the bare fight: Every given hit give 1 point, and every taken hit gives 2 points. Just bare fights included

### **Mid-Term**

* Having and upgrading armament like armor, sword, etc.
* Anti-bot protections.
* There will be some player heroes defined by us like Gorilla, humans, etc. We will add the feature of creating our own hero with all animations later. From profile photos to all these personalizations will require FUKC to burn.

### **Long Term**

* Boss: At first, players will just change the name and the photo of the boss. But if we can have enough funds for development, players will start to change the whole fucking animation.
  * Future Implementations:
    * Position-based body parts: People will be able to upload drawings of the body parts based on the position. We will provide the default file and they can change it as they wish. Body type, hair, arms, and legs.
    * The whole fucking animation
* Uploading custom heroes with custom animations and armament.
  * People can add their custom heroes and we can check, adjust, and approve their heroes and make them available for everyone to use. Price: $1000 worth of FUKC
  * Custom Heroes would have a royalty fee that can be set and changed. Players who play with these Heroes will give x% of their earnings to the owner of these heroes. The royalty fee can not be greater than 10%. If the owner changes the royalty fee, the players who chose that hero will be notified and be switched to a royalty-free genesis hero. It is important to protect players.
* Multiplayer
  * 3-5 players start together to the level and the first one who reaches the boss, fukcs. Players can't damage each other and the difficulty of the level's paths will reset for each game.
  * PvP Maps: Players start from different parts of the map. They kill each other and the last one fukcs the boss. We can have a new separate boss for this type of gameplay. Maps can include bots or not.
  * In the future, we can add fukc battles. 1vs1 or 5vs5 team battles. Players choose a character and upgrade it. Just like brawl stars, but if you lose your strength (health), you give up and get fucked! And people get your money!
    * Again, after fukc battles, we can make tournaments.
  * Rocket Leauge style communication tool but with sound. Gangs have custom sounds and texts.
* Procedural level generation: The system generates a procedural map and random difficulty with its different paths. Maps and their difficulties would change after the player completes the level. All players will have their own unique map. No daily reset. It resets after every win. Therefore, a new continues journey after each win.
* Another future might be betting. Betting can start at an early age. First, people can bet which character will get selected for the next seance, after the fukc battles, people can start betting on tournaments.
