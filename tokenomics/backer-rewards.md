# Backer Rewards

Backer Rewards are **80% of the total supply.** Tokenomics rewards backers and backers share this reward with heroes, selectors, creators, and even with holders by burning some of it.

Backer rewards will be distributed unevenly across all levels. Higher levels will have exponentially higher rewards to reward the best players more. Every level has a different weight on the Backer Rewards pool.&#x20;

Reward Weight = (Level)² / 80

Reward Weight of level 5 is 5²/80 = 0.31 and weight of the level 20 is 20²/80 = 5. The share of the level 5 is 0.87% with its 0.31 Reward Weight. You can see the share of all levels below. Each seance there will be roughly 306,849 FUKC to distribute backers.

Funding will be exponentially higher in the higher levels with an increased burning rate up to 72.5%.  This high-reward, high-burn model will decrease inflation dramatically. You can see the details about all the burning mechanisms and inflation on the [Burn Mechanism and Inflation](burn-mechanisms-and-inflation.md) page.
