# Minting and Electing Boss

Every level has its own level boss. Boss elections are the backbone of We Fukc. Players will elect a new boss for each level for each seance. Backers will elect the boss by funding it.&#x20;

The most funded boss will be elected for the following seance and the funds of other bosses **who lost** elections will burn. Some of the funds of the **elected** boss will burn and the rest of it will be distributed as a reward. You can check the [Boss Reward](boss-rewards.md) for the details about the distribution of the funds of the elected bosses.

**Caution!** When a boss loses the election, 100% of its funds will burn! You can't get back your funds if your boss loses the election!

Boss selections and boss elections are highly risky but highly rewarding as well!

## Minting, Selecting, and Electing Boss

Every boss will be minted, selected, and elected to get fukced! Minting is a one-time process but every seance you have to select a boss to make it a candidate for the next seance.

### Minting Boss

Every boss has a couple of properties to set. When you want to mint a new boss, you inherit an existing boss as the parent boss. You should change at least one of the properties of your parent boss to mint a new boss.

{% hint style="info" %}
The cost of minting a boss will be 1,000 FUKC. We will update the cost of mint to have a sustainable economy. It will always be profitable for appealing bosses!

Changeable properties are small properties that are listed above, set the location, and set the zoom level. You can't change fundamental things that set a boss's identity.

### Selecting Boss

You can select a boss as a candidate for a level by burning at least 1 FUKC token. If that boss is already selected, you can burn more FUKC than the person who already selected that boss or you can select a different boss as a candidate for that level.&#x20;

Be careful, if someone else burns more than you have burned, you can't get your tokens back because they are all burned!

You can find existing bosses from the boss list. Once you select a boss from the list, your boss will be displayed in the selection list of that level. Once the selection ends, selected bosses will be displayed in the candidate list.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The same boss can be selected for different levels in the same seance.
{% endhint %}

### Electing Boss

The election of a boss is similar to the selection of it. Backers choose a candidate from the candidate list and fund it. Once the election end, the most funded boss will be the boss of that level in the following seance. The fund of the bosses that lost the elections will burn. So it is important to be careful!

Some of the funds of the elected boss will burn and the remaining of it will be distributed as a reward to players, backers, the selector, and the creator of that boss. See details in [Boss Rewards.](boss-rewards.md)

#### The difference between the selections and the elections

Every boss has just one selector to make a candidate in the selections and every boss can be a candidate. On the other hand, everyone can be a backer of a specific boss and share all the rewards in the elections but only one boss can be elected.

Selections: **All bosses** can be candidates but **one account can be** a selector of it and have the selector reward for itself.

Elections: **Only one boss** can be elected but **everyone can be** a backer of it and share the backer reward together.
