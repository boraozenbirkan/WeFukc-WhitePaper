Q: How to select a character for a level to fuck?

A: To select a character, you need to burn some amount of token. The first level will require 1 FUKC (token) to select. The token requirement will increase 10-fold for the following levels. For instance, level 5 will require 10000 FUKC to select a character. Each selected character will be listed in the next seance's candidate list. People will burn tokens to choose the next seance's character for each level. Once you burn tokens to choose, you can not get back your tokens. If your character isn't chosen, you'll lose your money.\


Q: How much people will earn for each character they fukc.&#x20;

A: It depends on 3 main parameters: how many people can fuck the character, how many tokens burned for that character to choose, and the level. The reward will be distributed among all the fuckers after each seance. For instance, if 100 people fucks a character for just one time, the reward will be distributed to these 100 people equally. Your reward will increase as you fuck the same character.
