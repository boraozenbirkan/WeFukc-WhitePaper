# Reward Distribution

Higher levels will get higher rewards. The reward will be distributed based on the Reward-Weight of the level. Reward Weight Formula is an exponential graph: RW = L^2 / 80 (R: Reward Weight, L: Level) For instance, with this formula, level 5 has 0.313 RW (0.87%), level 10 has 1.25 RW(3.48%) , and level 20has 5 RW (13.94%). if the system minted and will distribute 100 FUCK for this seance, voters of level 20's selected character will share 13.94 FUKC among each other while voters of level 5 will share 0.313 FUKC.\
Basically, the system is like that: We give a reward to voters, and voters give the reward to players.\
We give exponentially more rewards to higher levels. Therefore, they can provide more rewards for higher levels and make that levels worth playing.  At higher levels, rewards will raise as well as the burn rate. Therefore, we balance the inflation.
