# Gameplay

There are 20 levels in We Fukc. Every 5 levels have a different theme and enemies to fight against. After completing a level, you can finally fukc the level boss. And please, enjoy it.

Every level has different paths to complete the level. These paths can be longer or shorter than each other and have a different set of difficulties in terms of the number of enemies, the type of enemies, and the number of traps.

There will be different heroes that players can play with. Each hero will have different characteristics and skills that are suitable for different situations. You can select any of them and kick some ass. You can buy some armaments for your hero to complete levels much easier. Weapons and shields will be necessary for upper levels to complete. But don't worry! You don't have to spend extra money from your pocket! Your earnings that come from the lower levels will be more than enough to buy armament to complete levels. If you are a skilled player, you would save a great deal of FUKC!

If you want to create your own custom boss for players to fukc or participate in the election of the bosses, you can check the "[Minting and Electing Boss](tokenomics/minting-and-electing-boss.md)" page. We highly recommend you check the "[Roles](roles.md)" page to see all the entities in the game.
