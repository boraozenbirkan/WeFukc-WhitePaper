# We FUKC

We Fukc is a protest platformer game. With the Web3 revolution, players truly own the items and their data. With We Fukc, players not only own the data, but they also change the content of the game from level boss to SFX.&#x20;

There are 20 levels in We Fukc and each level has its own level boss. In a normal game, you would fight against the level boss, right? But it is not the case here. **WE FUKC** the level boss.&#x20;

It is worth noting that everyone fukcs the exact same boss on a level. **Every week is a different seance in the game.** And for each seance players create their own custom boss and select it as a candidate for the next seance's level. Then again players select the level boss among these candidates for each level. Once players select a boss for a level, all players fukc that boss on that level in the following seance!

If you want to learn more about creating, selecting, and electing a level boss, you can check the "[Minting and Electing Boss](tokenomics/minting-and-electing-boss.md)" page.&#x20;

Let's talk about our other differences from most of the P2E games in the ecosystem

| Subject                     | We Fukc                                                                                                                   | Others                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sales**                   | No token sale at all, No NFT sale, No VC investments, No entry fee. It's all fukcing free!                                | Almost all of them hold a couple of token sales, NFT sales. VCs hold large amount of their token and you pay to play. Classic. |
| C**ommunity Allocation**    | **+90%** of total supply allocated for players!                                                                           | Generally around **40% to 60%** allocation for players                                                                         |
| **Team Allocation**         | Just **4%** for the team                                                                                                  | Generally around **15% to 30%** alocation for the team                                                                         |
| **Income Mechanism**        | Dynamic income. Fewer players earn more, more players earn less. Just like Bitcoin or other blockchains' income mechanism | Fixed income leads to a collapse after a certain point.                                                                        |
| **Reward Rate Mechanism**   | Prevents bots from consuming all the treasury and distributes it more fairly                                              | Most of them don't have such a protective mechanism. Bots earn the most of the treasury                                        |
| **Read and Write Approach** | Players add and change the content of the game collectively                                                               | Players only play the same game                                                                                                |
