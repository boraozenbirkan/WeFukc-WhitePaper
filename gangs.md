# Gangs

Gangs are the guilds of We Fukc. Gangs will be the most influential part of the boss elections. Therefore, it is highly important to be a part of a gang and act together to save your ass and kick some ass.

Apart from the organizational benefit of gangs, they will have three different privileges. Gang bangs, gameplay customization, and direct contact with developers and community managers.

### Gang Bang

Gang bangs are PvP fights that will occur in 3v3 and 5v5 modes. All team players will be a member of the same gang. So, you can't fight with someone from a different gang as a team player. This is gang bang, the Gangs bang. Not players.

There will also be tournaments among gangs. Tournaments and gang bangs will have different prize pools. If you want to be alone and not participate in any of these, watch your ass in elections.&#x20;

For those who wonder that "who shall we fukc if there is no boss?". Yes, you probably guessed right! You opponents! Members of the gang will fukc the members of the loser gang! It will be so hard to watch. It ain't the level boss, it's you who gets fukced up!

### Customize Gameplay

Gangs will be able to customize some of the content of the game into whatever they want. It is like the level boss, but it will be available just for the members of the gang. Not global. Basically, gangs that are big enough to burn some amount of FUKC to activate that feature for their gang will be able to do that.&#x20;

You can think that like boosting a Discord server. If your gang collects some amount of FUKC to burn, your gang will be able to upload its own SFX and VFX of the player and the enemy. All gang members will have the same SFX and VFX. They can choose the default options or choose the gang's options.
