# Roles

There are a couple of roles that you can take as you wish. These are the roles that you can take while We Fukc:

**Fighters:** You can play the game, kill the agents of the boss, and fukc the boss! fighters who fukc the boss will share **50%** of [Boss Rewards](tokenomics/boss-rewards.md). Being a fighter is totally free. Just choose your fighter, kick some ass, and fukc the bosses! You can check the "[Reward Rate Mechanism](tokenomics/reward-rate-mechanism-rrm.md)" page to see details about how much you can make.

**Creators:** You can create and mint a boss for fighters to fukc! You can make anything or anyone a boss. Creators share **2%** of the [Boss Rewards](tokenomics/boss-rewards.md). If you can make a boss that people really love to fukc, you can make high returns over time! A boss can have only one creator.

**Selectors:** You can select a boss as a candidate for backers to elect. You have the chance to be a selector every seance. Selectors share **10%** of the [Boss Rewards.](tokenomics/boss-rewards.md) Each boss can have only one selector for each level.

**Backers:** Backers choose the boss of the level by funding it. You can fund a boss and make it the boss of the level in the following seance. Backers share **38%** of the [Boss Rewards](tokenomics/boss-rewards.md) and share [Backer Rewards](tokenomics/backer-rewards.md). Backer Rewards are **80%** of the total supply of FUKC tokens. Being a backer is a highly risky but highly rewarding role.

**Clan Leaders and High Command:** There will be clans for people to gather under one name and fight together and earn more! You can be the leader of your clan or have a seat on high command of a clan. Either way, you can have a decent salary thanks to clan treasury! Check the [Lords and Clans](lords.md) for further details.

**Lords:** The best and most rewarding role in the game is being a fukcing lord! Lords create clans and get 10% tax from their treasury. There will be a maximum of 512 lords. Being a lord can be costly but highly rewarding. Check the [Lords and Clans](lords.md) for further details.

Check the "[Minting and Electing Boss](tokenomics/minting-and-electing-boss.md)" page for details about being a creator, selector, or backer.
