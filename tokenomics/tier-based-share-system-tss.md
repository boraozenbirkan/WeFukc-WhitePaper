# Tier-Based Share System (TSS)

Tier-based share system motivates players to invite their friends and help the community to grow. After each seance, 10% of the earnings of players will go to their up-tier account. Players will pass 50% of what they earn from their down-tier to their up-tier if it is greater than 1 FUKC. If it is equal to or less than 1 FUKC, 100% of income from the down-tier will go to the player's account balance.&#x20;

For instance, if you have earned 100 FUKC in a seance, you'll receive 90 FUKC and pass 10 FUKC to your up-tier. Your up-tier will receive 10 FUKC but pass 5 FUKC to its up-tier and 5 FUKC to its account balance.&#x20;

Everyone can only have one up-tier but limitless down-tier. You can always add, delete or change your up-tier. If you don't have any up-tier, 20% of your earnings will burn. So, it is better to have an up-tier. If you don't know anybody, then the system can randomly select for you. You can't change, delete, or add any down-tier. People who register with your tier code will be your down-tier. They can select you as their up-tier after registration.
