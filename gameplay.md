# Gameplay



**Gameplay:** You fight and kill creatures to fukc the boss of the level. Once you fukc the boss, you unlock the next level. You can continue or play any other unlocked levels as you wish.

* Add different paths to complete the level and each path should have different difficulties to get through. Reset the difficulty of the paths randomly every day. Therefore people can have more fun while they try to find the easiest path to complete.
* Maps will be fixed but creatures and snares will differ by the difficulty of the level. Upper levels will be longer to complete.
* In summary, this system will:
  * encourage people to play a decent amount of time, not all day.
  * encourage people to play higher levels
  * demotivate potential bots
  * distribute the reward more equally

Every week is a seance !!!
