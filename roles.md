# Roles

There are a couple of roles that you can take as you wish. These are the roles that you can take while We Fukc:

**Heroes:** You can play the game, kill the protectors of the boss, and fukc the boss! Fighters who fukc the boss will share **50%** of [Boss Rewards](tokenomics/boss-rewards.md). Being a player is totally free. Just choose your hero, kick some ass, and fukc the bosses! You can check the "[Reward Rate Mechanism](tokenomics/earnings-by-fukcing-bosses.md)" page to see details about how much you can make.

**Creators:** You can create and mint a boss for heroes to fukc! You can make anything or anyone a boss. Creators share **2%** of the [Boss Rewards](tokenomics/boss-rewards.md). If you can make a boss that people really love to fukc, you can make high returns over time! A boss can have only one creator. In future updates, you will be able to upload your own hero and everyone will be able to play with your hero. You will be able to have a royalty fee on these custom heroes (0-10%).

**Selectors:** You can select a boss as a candidate for backers to elect. You have the chance to be a selector every seance. Selectors share **10%** of the [Boss Rewards.](tokenomics/boss-rewards.md) Each boss can have only one selector for each level.

**Backers:** Backers choose the boss of the level by funding it. You can fund a boss and make it the boss of the level in the following seance. Backers share **38%** of the [Boss Rewards](tokenomics/boss-rewards.md) and share [Backer Rewards](tokenomics/backer-rewards.md). Backer Rewards are **80%** of the total supply of FUKC tokens. Being a backer is a highly rewarding role.
