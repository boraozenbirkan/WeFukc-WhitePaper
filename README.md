# We FUKC

A pixel game where people fight against creatures to fukc boss of the level. There will be multiple levels and each level will have different characters. Each character will have its own profile and there will be a list of characters. Every week, people will choose a character from that list for a specific level to fuck. People can either choose a character from that list or can create a new character to list. Every character profile will have a profile photo, animations (run, fuck, etc.), and sounds (SFX and Music). When people want to create a new character, they will choose a base character to inherit all the properties. They can either choose a default character or a character from the character list and change all or some of its parts.

\
You need to burn to create a character. You'll burn different amounts of tokens for each part that you change in a character. It can be a default character or a listed character. For instance, if you like a character from the list but don't like its SFX, you can inherit it and change its SFX and burn some tokens to mint this character. The amount of token that needs to burn will be correlated with the amount of data that needs to be stored.

\
Every week will be a different seance. People who can catch and fuck, will get their rewards after each seance.
