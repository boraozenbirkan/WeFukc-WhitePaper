# We FUKC

A pixel game where people fight against creatures to fukc boss of the level. There will be multiple levels and each level will have different characters. Each character will have its own profile and there will be a list of characters. Every week, people will choose a character from that list for a specific level to fuck. People can either choose a character from that list or can create a new character to list. Every character profile will have a profile photo, animations (run, fuck, etc.), and sounds (SFX and Music). When people want to create a new character, they will choose a base character to inherit all the properties. They can either choose a default character or a character from the character list and change all or some of its parts.

\
You need to burn to create a character. You'll burn different amounts of tokens for each part that you change in a character. It can be a default character or a listed character. For instance, if you like a character from the list but don't like its SFX, you can inherit it and change its SFX and burn some tokens to mint this character. The amount of token that needs to burn will be correlated with the amount of data that needs to be stored.\
Every week will be a different seance. People who can catch and fuck, will get their rewards after each seance.\
Q: How to select a character for a level to fuck?A: To select a character, you need to burn some amount of token. The first level will require 1 FUKC (token) to select. The token requirement will increase 10-fold for the following levels. For instance, level 5 will require 10000 FUKC to select a character. Each selected character will be listed in the next seance's candidate list. People will burn tokens to choose the next seance's character for each level. Once you burn tokens to choose, you can not get back your tokens. If your character isn't chosen, you'll lose your money.\
Q: How much people will earn for each character they fukc. A: It depends on 3 main parameters: how many people can fuck the character, how many tokens burned for that character to choose, and the level. The reward will be distributed among all the fuckers after each seance. For instance, if 100 people fucks a character for just one time, the reward will be distributed to these 100 people equally. Your reward will increase as you fuck the same character.\
Token Distribution of a **chosen character**: The Percentage of the reward is decreasing linearly as the levels increase but the amount of reward will increase exponentially.

* Burns: 25%, 27.5%, 30%, 32.5%....72.5% for the level 20.
* Reward: 75%, 72.5%, 70%, 67.5%...27.5% for the level 20.
*
  * 50% - To Fukcers (equally for each fukc)
  * 38% - To people who choose the character
  * 10% - To the person who listed that character
  * 2% - To the person who created that character

These were the tokens that come from character selection. The system will distribute new tokens to those who select the new character. Therefore, voters are the ones who get the token reward from the system. They will be the one who earns the most but they will also be the ones who take the risk of losing!\

Higher levels will get higher reward. Reward will be distributed based on Reward-Weight of the level. Reward Weight Formula is an exponantial graph: RW = L^2 / 80 (R: Reward Weight, L: Level) For instance, with this formula, level 5 has 0.313 RW (0.87%), level 10 has 1.25 RW(3.48%) , and level 20has 5 RW (13.94%). if system minted and will distribute 100 FUCK for this seance, voters of level 20's selected character will share 13.94 FUKC among each other while voters of level 5 will share 0.313 FUKC.\
Basically the system is like that: We give reward to voters, voters give the reward to players.\
We give exponentially more reward to higher levels. Therefore, they can provide more reward for higher levels and make that levels worth to play.  In higher levels, reward will raise as well as the burn rate. Therefore, we balance the inflation.\


**Gameplay:** You fight and kill creatures to fukc boss of the level. Once you fukc the boss, you unlock the next level. You can continue or play any other unlocked levels as you wish.

* Add different paths to complete the level and each path should have different difficulty to get through. Reset the difficulty of the paths randomly everyday. Therefore people can have more fun while they try to find the easiest path to complete.
* Maps will be fixed but ceatures and snares will differ by difficulty of the level. Upper levels will be longer to complete.
* Players will get lower shares as they continue to win the levels. This means their reward will decrease per win. Therefore, we will encourage people to play decent amount of time. Not all day. With this feature, we will demotivate potential bot attacks. Because of their earnings decreases after each fukc, this will encourage people to play in the highest level they can fukc.
* Rewards will decrease 2% after each win regardless of the level. For instance, normally you get 100 points each time when you complete a level. Like, if you complete level 1 5 times, you get 500 level-1 points: 500 L1P. But with this system you will get 100 points for the first time, then 98, 96, and so on. And it is a level agnostic system. This means your earnings will decrease regardless of the level you complete. If you complete level 1 for the first time, you get 100 Level-1 points, then if you continue to level 2 and complete it, you'll get 98 level 2 points instead of 100 level 2 points. So, it is better for you to play at the highest level you can fukc. Because higher levels will have higher rewards and you wouldn't waste your rewards in the lower levels.
* After each fukc: Reward = Reward Rate \* 100 Level X Points then Reward Rate = Reward Rate - 0.02; | Reward resests and starts everyday as default value. Default value is 1.
* In summary, this system will:
  * encourage people to play a decent amount of time, not all day.
  * encourage people to play higher levels
  * demotivate potential bots
  * distribute the reward more equally
* Profit Index: Every level selection will have a profit index to warn or encourage people about the profit/loss they can get. If people lock too many&#x20;
* Boss
  * The level Boss should have a fukcing background to set. People can choose unique or viral backgrounds.
* **Future Implementations:**
  * Multiplayer
    * 3-5 players start together to the level and the first one who reaches the boss, fuks. Players can't damage each other and the difficulty of the level's paths will reset for each game.
    * PvP Maps: Players start from different parts of the map. They kill each other and the last one fuks the boss. We can have a new seperate boss for this type of gameplay. Maps can include bots or not.
  * Add hidden places for bonus. Those hidden places should be randomly selected. But they would be in the most difficult paths more often.
  * Having and upgrading armament like armor, sword, etc.
  * Anti-bot protections.
  * Procedural level generation: The system generates a procedural map and random diffuculty with its different paths. Maps and their difficulties would change for after player completes the level. All players will have their own unique map. No daily reset. It resets after evert win. Therefore, a new continues journey after each win.
  * In the future, we can add fukc battles. 1vs1 or 5vs5 team battles. Players choose a character and upgrade it. Just like brawl stars, but if you lose your strenght (health), you give up and get fucked! And people gets your money!
  * Again, after fukc battles, we can make tournaments.
  * Another future might be betting. Betting can start with early ages. First, people can bet which character will get selected for the next seance, after the fukc battles, people can start betting on tournaments.
  * There will be some player characters defined by us like Gorilla, human, etc. We will add the feature of creating own character with all animations later. From profile photo to all this personalizations will require FUKC to burn.

**Tier-base Contribution Reward(TCR):** 10% of what people earn will go to their up-tier. People will pass 50% of what they earn from their down-tier to their up-tier  if it is greater than 1 FUKC. If it is equal or less than 1 FUKC, no TX. This will happen after every seance.  For instance, if you have earned 100 FUKC in a seance, you'll receive 90 FUKC and pass 25 FUKC to your up-tier. Your up-tier will receive 10 FUKC but pass 5 FUKC to its uptier and actually receive 5 FUKC. Everyone can only have one up-tier but limitless down-tier. This tier-based contribution reward system encourages people to invite other people to the game. You can always add, delete or change your up-tier. If you don't have any up-tier, your tokens TCR tokens burn. You can't change, delete, or add any down-tier. People who registers with your tier code will be your down-tier. They can select you as their up-tier after registeration.\


## Problems

* Liquidity Pool problem

## **Notes for this project:**

* Like hodl and buidl, we will use Fukc instead of Fuck. This will avoid censorship for the bad word and suit crypto terms.
* Motto: Let's Fukc! | PoF system: Proof-of-Fukc
* Our logo: Black Heart
* We will store the character data in both IPFS and our servers to have an efficient system. When people mint a character, they will have its NFT with metadata that is stored in IPFS but when they play the game we will send the data directly from our server to provide better performance.
* There will be lists like "Most Fukced", "Best Fukcer" and some medals like "The Best Fukcer of Seance #35" or "Serial Fukcer"
* Aspects of the game
  * It's a well-designed blockchain game. Therefore people will make sustainable money.
  * It's a retro game with procedural levels. Fun to play.
  * It has **a** social and political side. You can select your ex-girlfriend/boyfriend or your school teacher as the level boss and everyone fukcs it IF you have enough token to do. Or people can select politicians as a boss and fukc him/her altogether and make money!
  * You can make money without playing it!
  * Strong tokenomics
* Taking back your funds from a selection: It can be cool but it would give a lot of harm to people and demotivate them to participate in the selection. For instance, a whale can create 2 characters and stake 1000 tokens to one of them and 100 to the other. People stake their funds in the biggest character to guarantee to be on the winning side. Then whale can withdraw its funds from the biggest character right before the ending of the selections.  Then the whale's little character wins the selection and the whale gets all the money for him with a little fund. Making 10x-20x return in just 1 selection. So, we can't implement withdraw function to the selections. Whales still can manipulate the selections by funding multiple characters and making a final move at the last second but in this case whales' earnings would be nothing if we compare it to the scenario when there is a withdraw function. Because they would lose all the tokens they fund on their fake characters. Withdraw function reduces the competitiveness of the low-budget players and ruins the whole game.
