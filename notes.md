## **Notes for this project:**

* Motto: Let's Fukc! | PoF system: Proof-of-Fukc
* Our logo: Black Heart
* We will store the character data in both IPFS and our servers to have an efficient system. When people mint a character, they will have its NFT with metadata that is stored in IPFS but when they play the game we will send the data directly from our server to provide better performance.
* There will be lists like "Most Fukced", "Best Fukcer" and some medals like "The Best Fukcer of Seance #35" or "Serial Fukcer"
* Aspects of the game
  * It's a retro game with procedural levels. Fun to play.
  * It has **a** social and political side. You can select your ex-girlfriend/boyfriend or your school teacher as the level boss and everyone fukcs it IF you have enough token to do. Or people can select politicians as a boss and fukc him/her altogether and make money!
  * You can make money without playing it!
  * Strong tokenomics
* **Taking back your funds from a selection:** It can be cool but it would give a lot of harm to people and demotivate them to participate in the selection. For instance, a whale can create 2 characters and stake 1000 tokens to one of them and 100 to the other. People stake their funds in the biggest character to guarantee to be on the winning side. Then whale can withdraw its funds from the biggest character right before the ending of the selections.  Then the whale's little character wins the selection and the whale gets all the money for him with a little fund. Making 10x-20x return in just 1 selection. So, we can't implement withdraw function to the selections. Whales still can manipulate the selections by funding multiple characters and making a final move at the last second but in this case whales' earnings would be nothing if we compare it to the scenario when there is a withdraw function. Because they would lose all the tokens they fund on their fake characters. Withdraw function reduces the competitiveness of the low-budget players and ruins the whole game.

### Gameplay Notes

* Profit Index: Every level selection will have a profit index to warn or encourage people about the profit/loss they can get. If people lock too many the index should be red and low!
  * Additionally, we should add a warning to the elections that says "Learn the election mechanisms and fund a reasonable amount to protect yourself against the high risks!"
* We will keep players' earnings centrally held but every player can get their funds anytime. Even if players don't get their funds, we will send their funds to their wallets automatically if their funds are worth more than 100 dollars.&#x20;
* Add different paths to complete the level and each path should have different difficulties to get through. Reset the difficulty of the paths randomly every day. Therefore people can have more fun while they try to find the easiest path to complete.
* Maps will be fixed but creatures and snares will differ by the difficulty of the level. Upper levels will be longer to complete.
* Every 5 levels should have a different environment to play like different seasons. Like first 5 levels are green, bright, and a happy environment with easy enemies. But the last 5 levels (16-20) are the hardest and darkest environment. Let's call these different environments chapters.
  * Chapter 1: Green, happy, open space. Human enemies. Easy traps, less dangerous.
  * Chapter 2: Castle, Human enemies with enhanced armament. Tricky traps, give more damage.
  * Chapter 3: Underground, cave-like environment. Creatures start to appear, dreadful traps that give more damage.
  * Chapter 4: Core of the earth. Lava. Deamon-like mini-bosses and creatures. 1 shot traps.
  * Elements of different chapters: **3 types of enemy, 1 mini-boss, traps, and mapping.**
* Boss: At first, players will just change the name and the photo of the boss. But if we can have enough funds for development, players will start to change the whole fucking animation.
  * Future Implementations:
    * Position-based body parts: People will be able to upload drawings of the body parts based on the position. We will provide the default file and they can change it as they wish. Body type, hair, arms, and legs.
    * The whole fucking animation
* We should provide a preview of the sex scene on the minting page. People should be able to see what they are minting. It is $100 dollar!

## **Future Implementations:**

* Uploading custom heroes with custom animations and armament.
  * People can add their custom heroes and we can check, adjust, and approve their heroes and make them available for everyone to use. Price: $1000 worth of FUKC
  * Custom Heroes would have a royalty fee that can be set and changed. Players who play with these Heroes will give x% of their earnings to the owner of these heroes. The royalty fee can not be greater than 10%. If the owner changes the royalty fee, the players who chose that hero will be notified and be switched to a royalty-free genesis hero. It is important to protect players.
* Multiplayer
  * 3-5 players start together to the level and the first one who reaches the boss, fukcs. Players can't damage each other and the difficulty of the level's paths will reset for each game.
  * PvP Maps: Players start from different parts of the map. They kill each other and the last one fukcs the boss. We can have a new separate boss for this type of gameplay. Maps can include bots or not.
* Add hidden places as a bonus. Those hidden places should be randomly selected. But they would be on the most difficult paths more often.
  * There will be different types of heroes that are suitable for different environments. We can hide gems in places where players can't reach the most suitable hero. For instance, there are two different heroes. One of them is so strong but heavy, the other one light but fast. And you can complete a level with a strong hero. We can hide a gem in that level in a place where players can only reach with that light and fast hero. Maybe it jumps higher? The thing is players who discover this truth and play with an unsuitable hero to find the gem should be able to find it.
* Having and upgrading armament like armor, sword, etc.
* Anti-bot protections.
* Procedural level generation: The system generates a procedural map and random difficulty with its different paths. Maps and their difficulties would change after the player completes the level. All players will have their own unique map. No daily reset. It resets after every win. Therefore, a new continues journey after each win.
* In the future, we can add fukc battles. 1vs1 or 5vs5 team battles. Players choose a character and upgrade it. Just like brawl stars, but if you lose your strength (health), you give up and get fucked! And people get your money!
* Again, after fukc battles, we can make tournaments.
* Another future might be betting. Betting can start at an early age. First, people can bet which character will get selected for the next seance, after the fukc battles, people can start betting on tournaments.
* There will be some player characters defined by us like Gorilla, humans, etc. We will add the feature of creating our own character with all animations later. From profile photos to all these personalizations will require FUKC to burn.
