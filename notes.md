## **Notes for this project:**

* Like hodl and buidl, we will use Fukc instead of Fuck. This will avoid censorship for the bad word and suit crypto terms.
* Motto: Let's Fukc! | PoF system: Proof-of-Fukc
* Our logo: Black Heart
* We will store the character data in both IPFS and our servers to have an efficient system. When people mint a character, they will have its NFT with metadata that is stored in IPFS but when they play the game we will send the data directly from our server to provide better performance.
* There will be lists like "Most Fukced", "Best Fukcer" and some medals like "The Best Fukcer of Seance #35" or "Serial Fukcer"
* Aspects of the game
  * It's a well-designed blockchain game. Therefore people will make sustainable money.
  * It's a retro game with procedural levels. Fun to play.
  * It has **a** social and political side. You can select your ex-girlfriend/boyfriend or your school teacher as the level boss and everyone fukcs it IF you have enough token to do. Or people can select politicians as a boss and fukc him/her altogether and make money!
  * You can make money without playing it!
  * Strong tokenomics
* **Taking back your funds from a selection:** It can be cool but it would give a lot of harm to people and demotivate them to participate in the selection. For instance, a whale can create 2 characters and stake 1000 tokens to one of them and 100 to the other. People stake their funds in the biggest character to guarantee to be on the winning side. Then whale can withdraw its funds from the biggest character right before the ending of the selections.  Then the whale's little character wins the selection and the whale gets all the money for him with a little fund. Making 10x-20x return in just 1 selection. So, we can't implement withdraw function to the selections. Whales still can manipulate the selections by funding multiple characters and making a final move at the last second but in this case whales' earnings would be nothing if we compare it to the scenario when there is a withdraw function. Because they would lose all the tokens they fund on their fake characters. Withdraw function reduces the competitiveness of the low-budget players and ruins the whole game.
