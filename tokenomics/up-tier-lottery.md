# Up-Tier Lottery

Each seance we will distribute some amount of FUKC to 1,000 players. This is a reward for Up-Tier players. Distribution will be a lottery based on down-tier earnings. Basically, those who have more down-tier will have more chances to earn these rewards.&#x20;

In this up-tier lottery, every player will earn the same ticket amount as they earn FUKC tokens from their down-tiers. For instance, if a player earns 100 FUKC from its down-tiers in that seance, that player will have 100 tickets for that seance's Up-Tier Lottery.&#x20;

There will be 100 winners each seance. Every winner will get the 10% of the reward and pass it to the next winner. So, the first winner will have the 10% of the reward, the second winner will have 10% of the remaining reward, and so on. See the reward share for some winners in order:

* The first winner gets 10% of the reward,
* 2nd gets 9%
* 3rd 8.1%
* 5th 6.6%
* 10th 3.9%
* 20th 1.4%
* 50th 0.057%
* 100th, the last winner gets 0.0003% of the reward.

Share decreases dramatically after each winner. These shares seem quite low but we estimate that we will distribute approximately 10,000 FUKC each seance. The last winner will earn 0.03 FUKC with its 0.0003% share.&#x20;

Again, 0.03 FUKC might seems low if the game is not released and there is no token price yet. But if you consider that we **estimate** ALL PLAYERS who play level 1 will share 20-40 FUKC each seance. For instance, if 100,000 players play level 1 just one time, each player will earn 0.0002-0.0004 FUKC each seance. The last winner would earn 75x more than its reward from level 1. And it is all free. Just a reward to create a weekly excitement!
