# We Fukc DAO

A DAO is an inevitable part of the game. We Fukc DAO will have two main goals; Voting for upcoming updates and sensitive content.

We will discuss and vote on the upcoming updates or on the current features to remove or update. They can decide whether it should be implemented in the game or not. If we will implement an update, DAO can open a discussion about the content of the update. It can be the art style of it or a specific feature of it. Basically, players will actively participate in the development of the game.

The second purpose of the DAO is to prevent unpleasant situations that may occur in the future. Because everyone can upload a level boss and select or even elect it as a level boss, it creates a space for those who have bad intentions.&#x20;

Community members can open a discussion about a boss that has been created and listed in the game. If they find it unpleasant to take a part in the game, they can vote to remove it completely. If your identity takes a place in an unpleasant situation, you can report it we will remove it from being used.
